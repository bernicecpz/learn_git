# Intro Task: Learn Git
This repository is to practice and learn how to use git commands. In this guide, it will use this repository as a playground for the git commands. 

I try to make it less technical and hopefully easier to understand through the step by step exercises.

# Prerequisites
1. A git repository must be created before starting this tutorial.
2. To be bold & try out these command on the terminal :D
3. No worries about making any mistakes! Learning from them if any and move on!


# Outline of Topics
In each exercise under the Learn Git Journey, there will be key focus for the respective git commands

**Learn Git Journey**
1. _**Create local Git Repository**_
    `init`, `add`, `status`, `commit`, `pull`, `push`
2. _**Fetch vs Pull**_
    `fetch`, `pull`
    Optional : `diff`
3. _**Create branches**_
    `stash`,`branch`, `checkout`, `merge`
**Beyond Basics**
4. _**Rebase your commits**_
